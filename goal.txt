tring to extract features from song using librosa:
features being extracted:
1. chroma_stft
2.mfcc
3.spectral_contrast
4.beat.tempo

Based on these, we calculate the valence and arousal of the song.

Trained the model using data from DEAM. Valence and Arousal are provided for all songs in DEAM annotations folder.
Using 80:20 split on dataset for training:testing

Currently model is regression based (RandomForrestRegressor), somehow have to develop it to classify into 2,3 emotions
like happy, sad, angry, etc. based on the arousal and valence values.
